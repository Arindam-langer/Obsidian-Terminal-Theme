## Current Limitations

> This theme is a synonym of *limitation* (XD); here I only list a few that I think are worth mentioning.

* Not optimized for preview mode.
* Not optimized for community plugins.
* Hider style rules are not able to toggle off.
    * For example, you lose the ribbon forever.
* There may be some misalignment and dettachment of elements.
    * I will repair ASAP!
    * Please report!
* Peek Window (suggestion & preview) will take up the full width.

## Future & Thank You

I will keep optimizing this theme. I already have some features in my mind that I want to implement soon:

* Address some of the above limitations
* More color schemes
* More Style Settings
* Support more plugins
* Mobile support
* Better prompts & ASCII symbols design and customization support

I also have some wild ideas such as building plugins that work with the theme to provide a more *terminal-ish* experience.

I want to say thank you for trying my theme. If you see any bugs or have any suggestions and feature requests, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zcysxy/Obsidian-Terminal-Theme/issues) or just tag me `@Atlas#7560` on Discord, this theme won't be better without your generous help ;)
